I used expo to manage the RN app. If you want to start it from the code and you have all the necessary libraries, you can use "npx expo start" to start it and then use Expo Go on your Android device to bundle and test it.
I added a bunch of comments throughout the code to explain what I did and why.
I'm assuming if this code is ok we'll go through it on the technical call so I can provide more explanations if needed.
